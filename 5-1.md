# WordPress

## Prep

First, I need to verify that I'm using an appropriate version of PHP and MySQL.

```
php --version
mysql --version
```

Then I need to install some PHP modules that WordPress uses

```
sudo apt install php-curl php-xml php-imagick php-mbstring php-zip php-intl
```

Finally, need to restart apache and mysql.

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

## CLI Install WordPress

First, I need to install and extract WordPress

```
cd /var/www/html
sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
```

Followed by creating the database and database user

```
sudo mysql -u root

create user 'wordpress'@'localhost' identified by '<PASS>';
create database wordpress;
grant all privileges on wordpress.* to 'wordpress'@'localhost';
show databases;
```

Then insert pertinent information into the wp-config.php file as well as disabling FTP uploads.

```
cd /var/www/html/wordpress
sudo cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
sudo vim wp-config.php
```

and finally, change file ownership for the wordpress directory

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress
```

## GUI Install WordPress

To complete installation, I needed to enter the appropriate information into the WordPress GUI and click the Install WordPress button

## Post Install

After installation, I browsed through a number of templates and installed a few. I decided to go with Zino and did a few basic modifications to make align it more with what a potential library front page might look like.
