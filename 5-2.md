# Omeka

## Prerequisites
First I need to install the necessary prerequisites

```
sudo apt install -y imagemagick unzip 
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Database

Next I need to create the databases, the user, and assign the users permission to the database.
```
sudo mysql -u root
create user 'omeka'@'localhost' identified by 'XXXXXX';
create database omeka;
grant all privileges on omeka.* to 'omeka'@'localhost';
show databases;
\q
```

## Install Omeka
Now I can download and install Omeka

```
sudo wget https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/releases/download/v3.1.2/omeka-3.1.2.zip
sudo unzip omeka-3.1.2.zip -d /var/www/html/
cd /var/www/html
sudo mv omeka-3.1.2 omeka
```

I initially had an issue with unzip because I assumed it worked like, `sudo unzip <file> <dir>` but this threw an error message saying it couldn't find the filename <dir>.
I ended up having to use the -d flag to tell unzip where to unzip the file too.

## Configure Omeka
Next I need to configure the Omeka db.ini file and set permissions

```
cd omeka
sudo vim db.ini
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/omeka
```

## Restart Services
Then restart the apache and mysql services

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

## Complete Install
Ran into an issue here. Was getting a 500 internal server error when trying to navigate to the /omeka page. /Wordpress worked fine. Deleted the directory and went throught he steps again with no luck. Ended up checking the apache logs to discovery the following error message. 

```
 /var/www/html/omeka/.htaccess: Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
```

Quick google lead me to discover that I skipped the step where I was supposed to enable mod_rewrite. I guess that is what happens when you're going from following along with a guide (I wrote out the steps in a notepad file prior to starting) and trying to do documentation as you go. Probably should've finished everything then came back to document.

## Complete

Did a little color editing and created a logo.
