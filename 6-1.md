## Testing

The server was serving the default Apache page at first. Went back and realized that I forgot to run the a2 commands to disable the default setup, enable compressions, and enable the bibliolib site.

## Additional Tasks

### Add Patrons

First, I had to create a new patron category. I called it Patron.

Then I created 2 patrons. I don't love that you have to click "Search" before it shows the patrons. I would have assumed it would by default just list all the patrons on first load then allow filtering. I assume this is because the search is SUPER slow. Even with only 3 patrons, it took like 10 seconds to find my 3 patrons.

### Create Bibliographic Records

Adding books seemed a bit more complicated. I ended up creating a new MARC Bibliographic framework called Book however this may not have been necessary. I think used that framework to catalog 3 books. Some of the fields autofilled and I just left them how they were. I'm not really sure what they do.

### Check out Books
I feel like this process is more complicated than it has to be. Maybe there is a reason I'm missing.

### Delete patron circulation History

I haven't figured out how to clear patron circulation history. I've added the before image and will add an after image if I figure it out. I posted in Element in hopes someone can give me some insight.
