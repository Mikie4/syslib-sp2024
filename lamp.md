# Reflection
Relatively straightforward assignment. The biggest issues I ran into were typoes.
I did opt to use vim instead of nano for text editing. Even though I installed
w3m per the instructions, I did not like that it dropped me into an "editor" window
or whatever you want to call it. So I used curl whenever prompted to use w3m.

When verifying the php syntax, I did accidentally typo my user password in the login
file. This caused it to throw an access denied message

Other than that, everything went smoothly.
