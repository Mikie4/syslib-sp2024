# Nano

### This is a markdown document typed using Nano.

I have only used Nano a couple times in the past. I don't usually directly edit files in Linux.

I was a Ruby on Rails developer back in 2014. We primary used Vim for development on Ubuntu.

**This line was typed**

**This line was typed** <-- This line was copy-pasted



**This line was typed, then cut-pasted**


I also performed a "Where is" for 2014.


I also used "Read File" because I was curious what it did. It did what I expected it to do and read 
in another file starting at the cursor.

Then I used Undo, which I was glad existed because I didn't check before I read in the other file. 
I thought for a moment I was going to have to delete everything manually.

I did not copy in the nanorc file yet. I liked the idea of including the line numbers, however I am
currently working on an ephemeral docker container that will go away once I close the session. Once
we move to using our cloud VM, I will add that configuration file.

So, to sum things up:

- Opened Nano
- Types a few lines
- Copy-Pasted
- Cut-Pasted
- Used "Where Is"
- Used "Read File"
- Used "Undo"
- Used some Markdown
- Used "Write Out" to save
