# Week 7

## Sudo
Since I'm using a local VM, I had to install sudo, create a new user, and add the user 
to the sudoers list. These steps were not included in the screenshot.

## apt update and apt upgrade

## TLDR
This command was a little more than I want to include in a screenshot so I'm posting
the history output.

## yaz
I received the following error when trying to view the man pages.

I didn't want to increase the container footprint, so I referred to the bib1-attr 
documentation on the provided website.

Next I ran the example commands from the text. Like before, I output is quite verbose
so I don't want to include a ton of screenshots. The command history is included below.
I also included the exit message when exiting the yazcli. Seems someone has a sense of
humor
